# Secret-Agent

I’ve made an Agent Management system.

The agents contain an automatic Agent ID, their real name, a Ceasar Enncrypted codename and 2 languages they speak.

The real name and the 2 languages can be changed, and when changing the real name, the codename will also be changed automatically.

I’ve made a single webpage with three tasks:
Create a new agent.
See all agents.
And handle a single agent’s data.

The agents are placed in a static ArrayList.

The handling part has TextBox’s for a real name, two languages, an encryption string and encryption key, which tells how many letters to move through the alphabet.

The page has a nice design.
